# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves two critical infrastructure improvements for the AI Agent Server:

1. Consolidating configuration files to improve maintainability and reduce duplication
2. Migrating from standard Kafka to AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka) to leverage AWS's managed service benefits

These changes are part of the critical infrastructure improvements outlined in the Action Plan (Priority 1, items 1.2 and 1.3).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a unified configuration structure, so that I can more easily maintain and update configuration settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all configuration from a single unified configuration source
2. WHEN a service requires database configuration THEN the system SHALL provide consistent configuration from the unified source
3. WHEN a service requires Kafka configuration THEN the system SHALL provide consistent configuration from the unified source
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in all services that use the configuration
5. WHEN new configuration is added THEN the system SHALL follow the unified structure pattern
6. IF configuration values are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which values are required

### Requirement 2: AWS MSK Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use AWS MSK for Kafka messaging, so that I can leverage AWS's managed service benefits including improved security, scalability, and reduced operational overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to AWS MSK instead of standard Kafka
2. WHEN the application needs to publish messages THEN the system SHALL use AWS MSK client to publish messages
3. WHEN the application needs to consume messages THEN the system SHALL use AWS MSK client to consume messages
4. WHEN AWS MSK authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use IAM authentication
5. WHEN AWS MSK connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry with exponential backoff
6. IF AWS MSK configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail with clear error messages
7. WHEN migrating from standard Kafka THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing message formats
8. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate AWS MSK configuration for the environment (dev, staging, prod)
