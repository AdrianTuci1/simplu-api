# Simplified Cognito Integration

## Overview

The management server has been simplified to only use the basic user information that Cognito actually provides. This removes unnecessary complexity and focuses on the core authentication flow.

## What Cognito Provides

Cognito typically provides these basic user attributes:
- `sub` (subject) - Unique user identifier
- `username` - User's username
- `email` - User's email address
- `name` - Full name (if configured in Cognito)

## Simplified CognitoUser Interface

```typescript
export interface CognitoUser {
  userId: string;       // Cognito's 'sub' claim
  username: string;     // Cognito username
  email: string;        // Cognito email
  name?: string;        // Full name from Cognito (if available)
  firstName?: string;   // Extracted first name
  lastName?: string;    // Extracted last name
}
```

## What Was Removed

### From CognitoUser Interface
- ❌ `roles: string[]` - Not provided by Cognito
- ❌ `permissions: string[]` - Not provided by Cognito
- ❌ `isActive: boolean` - Not provided by Cognito
- ❌ `createdAt?: string` - Not provided by Cognito
- ❌ `lastModified?: string` - Not provided by Cognito

### From AuthService
- ❌ `validatePermission()` method - No longer needed
- ❌ `getUserGroups()` method - Not using Cognito groups
- ❌ `addUserToGroup()` method - Not managing groups
- ❌ `removeUserFromGroup()` method - Not managing groups
- ❌ `getPermissionsFromRoles()` method - No role-based permissions
- ❌ Complex mock data with roles and permissions

### From Auth Module
- ❌ `RolesGuard` - Removed role-based access control
- ❌ `@Roles()` decorator - Removed role decorator
- ❌ Role-based endpoint protection - All endpoints use only `CognitoAuthGuard`

## What Remains

### Core Authentication
- ✅ Token validation
- ✅ User extraction from JWT
- ✅ Name extraction and splitting
- ✅ Basic mock user for development
- ✅ `CognitoAuthGuard` for endpoint protection

### User Profile Management
- ✅ User profiles stored in DynamoDB
- ✅ Automatic name population from Cognito
- ✅ Payment method management
- ✅ Business data storage

## Data Flow

```
Cognito JWT Token
    ↓
Extract basic user info (userId, username, email, name)
    ↓
Split name into firstName/lastName
    ↓
Store/retrieve user profile from DynamoDB
    ↓
Return user profile with business data
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Only uses what Cognito actually provides
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No role/permission management in auth service
3. **Clear Separation**: Authentication vs. business logic
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain
5. **Realistic Implementation**: Matches actual Cognito capabilities

## Migration Impact

- ✅ Existing user profiles continue to work
- ✅ Name extraction still functions
- ✅ Payment methods still work
- ✅ No breaking changes to API endpoints
- ✅ Simplified development experience

## Future Considerations

If role-based access control is needed in the future, it should be implemented:
- In the business logic layer (not auth service)
- Using a separate permissions system
- Based on business rules rather than Cognito groups
