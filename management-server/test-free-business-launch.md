# Test: Free Business Launch

## Overview
This document describes how to test launching businesses without payment requirements.

## Changes Made
1. **Disabled payment validation** in `launchBusiness` method
2. **Set payment status to 'active'** when launching businesses
3. **Added comments** explaining the changes for future reference

## Test Flow

### 1. Configure Business (No Payment Required)
```bash
POST /businesses/configure
{
  "companyName": "Test Free Business",
  "businessType": "dental",
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Main Office",
      "address": "123 Test St",
      "timezone": "Europe/Bucharest"
    }
  ],
  "domainLabel": "test-free-business"
}
```

**Expected Result**: Business created with `status: 'suspended'` and `paymentStatus: 'unpaid'`

### 2. Launch Business (Skip Payment Step)
```bash
POST /businesses/{businessId}/launch
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Business becomes `active: true` and `status: 'active'`
- `paymentStatus` becomes `'active'`
- Infrastructure deployed successfully
- No payment validation errors

### 3. Verify Business Status
```bash
GET /businesses/{businessId}
```

**Expected Result**: Business should be fully active and operational

## Notes
- The payment setup step (`POST /businesses/:id/payment`) is now optional
- Businesses can be launched directly after configuration
- Payment validation can be re-enabled by uncommenting the validation code in `launchBusiness` method
- Free businesses won't be suspended by the grace period scheduler since they have `paymentStatus: 'active'`

## Reverting Changes
To re-enable payment requirements, uncomment these lines in `business.service.ts`:
```typescript
// const subscriptionStatus = await this.paymentService.refreshSubscriptionStatus(businessId);
// if (subscriptionStatus.status !== 'active' && subscriptionStatus.status !== 'trialing') {
//   throw new BadRequestException('Business subscription is not active. Please complete payment first.');
// }
```
