We will work on @management-server . We need to create a nestjs project that will receive a request to create tenants for various business types. Each business has general data like company name, registration number and location data. To be more specific @business-info.dto.ts (found in app) provides us data for a location. The ideea is that the management server will create this business and will handle plan payment to keep the business running, after a month of not paying data will be removed. Also users can modify certain fields or remove the business by themselves. Users can add multiple locations. The database will be a dynamodb table but bussines location creation will trigger more things including a cloudformation that builds a react projects and attribute a subdomain or a custom domain. Business creation can trigger also a domain aquisition. We plan to use stripe as a payment processor for this service. But we need to keep everything clean and modular. Please proceed on @management-server creation
